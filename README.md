# dynamic-svg-graph

An app that utilizes public CDN libraries like D3.js or similar js libraries to animate interactive SVG elements to create dynamic data visualizations based on any tabular dataset loaded into the app.  The app should use the Domo.js library and the Domo.get() function to retrieve data.  The app should allow the user 4 dropdown boxes.  They are x-axis, y-axis, category and series.  Each should contain the header names of the tabular dataset that is loaded, allowing the user to customize what the graph displays.  The output should create a stacked bar graph using the users selections.
